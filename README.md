# SipandPuffboat
This code is designed to operate a sonar boat utilizing sip and puff or joystick controller. You can switch the mode using a hardware switch mounted on the board. Depending on which controller you choose, code either converts pressure to velocity or X position of the joystick to velocity. This enables people with limited mobility to steer the boat
